    """
    Calculates the percentage of imbalanced samples based on the provided criteria.
    The criteria are either
    - ir_bound: According to Equation (4) in the article. All samples are considered to be imbalanced whos Imbalance Ratio is higher than the provided threshold. The minimum achievable Imbalance ratio is 1,
                which indicates no imbalance to be present. An ir_bound of 2 indicates that only samples are counted which occure twice or half as often as the provided relevance_pdf (Uniform if relevance_pdf=None).
    - lower_bound/upper_bound: According to Equation (3) in the article. All samples are considered imbalanced whos probability ratio is smaller/higher then the provided bound. If both bounds are provided the
                the imbalanced sample percentages are summed.

    The Imbalance ratio is the absolute magnitude of the probability ratio lambda. IR = exp(abs(log(lambda(x)))).
    Thus ir_bound = 2 equals the combined behaviour of lower_bound = 0.5 and upper_bound = 2.

    Args:
    - data (pd.Series | pd.DataFrame): Input data for which to compute the probability ratio.
    - relevance_pdf (Callable | list[Callable] | None, optional): Probability density function(s) for relevance probability.
      - If a Series is passed to `data`, `relevance_pdf` should be a single callable function.
      - If a DataFrame is passed to `data`, `relevance_pdf` should be a list of callable functions with one function per column in data.
      - It is assumed that each callable function returns a value of type float.
      - If None, default functions will be used for relevance probability, which assumes uniform distribution of the relevance.
    - discrete (bool | list[bool], optional): Indicates if the data is discrete.
      - If a Series is passed to `data`, `discrete` should be a single boolean value.
      - If a DataFrame is passed to `data`, `discrete` should be a list of boolean values with one value per column.
    - drop_inf_nan (bool, optional): Whether to drop infinite and NaN values from `data` before computation.
      Default is True.
    - ir_bound: Imbalance ratio threshold for considering samples imbalanced. If defined, excludes lower_bound and upper_bound.
    - lower_bound: Lower threshold for probability ratio lamb.
    - upper_bound: Upper threshold for probability ratio lamb.

    Returns:
    - (float): Percentage of imbalanced samples based on the given criteria.
